## HealthKart Food Label Cataloging Application

### Overview

This application is designed to process images of food labels, extract nutritional information, and determine whether the food is healthy or unhealthy. It leverages Google Cloud Vision for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and a generative AI model to analyze the text. The processed data is then stored in a MongoDB database.

### Features

- Upload an image or provide a URL to an image for processing.
- Perform OCR to detect and clean text from the image.
- Extract nutritional information from the detected text.
- Adjust nutrient values based on the serving size.
- Determine if the food is healthy or unhealthy using a generative AI model.
- Store the processed data in a MongoDB database.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Google Cloud Vision API credentials
- Google Generative AI API key
- MongoDB for data storage

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```cmd
    git https://github.com/Adi123XD/Food-Cateloging-.git
    cd Food-Cateloging-
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```cmd
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up the environment variables:
   - Create a .env file in the root directory of the project.
   - Add the following variables:

    ```python
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your-google-api-key>
    GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<path-to-your-google-cloud-credentials-json>
    MODEL_PATH=<path-to-your-model-file>
    MONGO_URI=<your-mongo-uri>
    ```

### File Structure

- main.py: Contains the main functions for OCR, text cleaning, nutrient extraction, and formatting data.
- webapp.py: Streamlit application interface for user interactions.
- mongo.py: Contains functions to interact with the MongoDB database.
- constants.py: Contains constant values and patterns used in the application.
- requirements.txt: Lists all the dependencies required for the project.
- .env: Environment variables (not included in the repository; must be created manually).

### Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:

    ```python
    streamlit run webapp.py
    ```

2. Upload an image or enter an image URL for processing.
3. Enter the image URL to store in the database.
4. Click the "Enter" button to start processing.
5. The application will display the detected text, extracted nutrients, and whether the food is healthy or unhealthy.
6. If the data is valid, it will be inserted into the MongoDB database.

### Functions

#### main.py

- format_data(input_dict): Formats the extracted nutrient data.
- convert_to_float(value): Converts a string to a float.
- healthy_unhealthy(ocr_text): Determines if the food is healthy or unhealthy using the AI model.
- adjust_nutrient_values(output, serving_size): Adjusts nutrient values based on the serving size.
- clean_ocr_text(text): Cleans the OCR-detected text.
- extract_nutrients(text): Extracts nutrient information from the cleaned text.
- detect_text(img_path): Performs OCR on the given image.

#### webapp.py

- Streamlit application interface for user interactions.

#### mongo.py

- insert_to_db(data, db_name, collection_name): Inserts data into the specified MongoDB collection.

#### constants.py

- Contains constant values and regular expressions used for nutrient extraction.

### Troubleshooting

- Ensure all required environment variables are set correctly in the .env file.
- Make sure your Google Cloud Vision API credentials are valid and correctly referenced in the environment variables.
- Verify that the MongoDB URI is correct and the database is accessible.
